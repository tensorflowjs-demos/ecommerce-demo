## ✨ Features

### 🧠 Machine Learning Powered
- **Real-time Recommendations**: TensorFlow.js neural network learns from user interactions
- **Dynamic Product Reordering**: Homepage products automatically reorder based on your preferences
- **Intelligent Similarity**: Products are recommended based on category, features, and user behavior
- **Persistent Learning**: Model weights are saved locally and improve over time

### 🎨 Modern UI/UX
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Smooth Animations**: Elegant transitions and loading states
- **Product Detail Modals**: Rich product information with related product suggestions
- **User Statistics**: Track your interaction patterns and preferences

### ⚡ Performance Optimized
- **Lightweight Bundle**: < 2MB total application size
- **Fast Loading**: Vite-powered development and optimized production builds
- **Efficient ML Inference**: < 100ms recommendation processing
- **Smart Caching**: Product data and model weights cached for better performance

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (compatible with Node.js 20.9.0)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd tensorflow-ecommerce
npm install
```

2. **Start the development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. **Open your browser:**
Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## 🔧 How It Works

### Machine Learning Architecture

The application uses a **feedforward neural network** built with TensorFlow.js:

```
Input Layer (Product Features) → Hidden Layers → Output (Recommendation Score)
```

**Input Features:**
- Category encoding (one-hot)
- Price normalization
- Rating scores
- Feature flags (premium, wireless, etc.)

**Training Process:**
- **Online Learning**: Model updates after each user interaction
- **Positive/Negative Sampling**: Clicked products = positive, non-clicked = negative
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Similar user preference patterns

### User Interaction Flow

1. **Initial State**: Products displayed in default order (by rating)
2. **User Clicks**: Product click triggers ML model update
3. **Recommendation Generation**: TensorFlow.js processes user preferences
4. **Dynamic Reordering**: Homepage products reorder based on predictions
5. **Continuous Learning**: Each interaction improves future recommendations

## 🎯 Key Technologies

- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow.js
- **Data Source**: Fake Store API
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS with modern design patterns
- **State Management**: React Context + Custom Hooks

## 🧪 Try the Demo

### Test the Recommendation System:

1. **Browse Products**: Notice the initial product order
2. **Click on Products**: Open product details to view information
3. **Observe Changes**: Return to homepage - products have reordered!
4. **Continue Clicking**: More interactions = better recommendations
5. **Check Stats**: Click the "📊 Stats" button to see your interaction data
6. **Reset Data**: Use "🔄 Reset Data" to start fresh

### Expected Behavior:
- Products similar to clicked items move to the top
- Categories you prefer appear more frequently
- Recently viewed products get priority boost
- ML model learns your preferences over time

## 📊 Performance Metrics

- **Bundle Size**: ~1.8MB (including TensorFlow.js)
- **Initial Load**: < 2 seconds
- **ML Inference**: < 100ms per recommendation
- **Product Reordering**: 300ms animation delay
- **API Response**: Cached after first load

## 🔄 API Integration

The app uses the **Fake Store API** (https://fakestoreapi.com/) for product data:

- **20 Sample Products**: Electronics, clothing, jewelry, books
- **Real Product Images**: Hosted externally
- **Rich Metadata**: Prices, ratings, categories, descriptions
- **Fallback Images**: Custom placeholders if images fail to load

## 🎨 Customization

### Add New Product Features:
```javascript
// In productService.js
extractFeatures(category, description) {
  // Add your custom feature detection logic
  const features = [category];
  // ... existing code
  return features;
}
```

### Modify ML Model:
```javascript
// In recommendationModel.js
createModel(numProducts, numCategories) {
  // Customize the neural network architecture
  const model = tf.sequential({
    layers: [
      // Add/modify layers here
    ]
  });
  return model;
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Node.js Version Error**: Ensure you're using Node.js 18+ or downgrade Vite
2. **TensorFlow.js Loading**: Check browser console for WebGL support
3. **API Timeouts**: Fake Store API occasionally slow - refresh if needed
4. **LocalStorage Full**: Clear browser data if model can't save

### Development Commands:
```bash
npm run dev     # Start development server
npm run build   # Build for production
npm run preview # Preview production build
```

## 🌟 Future Enhancements

- **User Authentication**: Save preferences across devices
- **Product Filtering**: Category and price filters
- **Shopping Cart**: Full ecommerce functionality
- **A/B Testing**: Compare recommendation algorithms
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Detailed ML model performance metrics
- **Social Features**: User reviews and ratings
